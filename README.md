# UX
## The purpose of this website is to present the following values:
Introduce myself, so that the recruiter can become familiar.

Show my detailed portfolio, by creating a simple and professional design, so that the recruiter can get impressed.

Make sure that there is an easy and quick way to reach the contact page.

Create a resposive design, which works in different screen sizes and devices, due the fact that people use more mobile devices nowadays.
# User Stories:
### 1. I am a recruiter who is looking for an experienced Full stack Developer with a good experience,positive attitude and willingness to learn.
### 2. My manager is immediately looking for a Manual Tester with some experience of Web Designing.
### 3. I am looking for a very dedicated, experienced and hard working  Full Stack Developer for a new project. Candidate should have an eagerness to learn new things and work with the team mate.
# Design Process:
### I began the design process by outlining the key features that I wanted in my website.  I decided of the four pages I would have on my website: 'Home', 'Resume' 'Website'and 'Contact'.
### I have given the navigation bar in the bottom of the header section.

# Testing
### Based on the above User stories the recruiter wants someone who has the experience and quality of Full Stack Development. In the website sufficient explanations of the skills and work done is given so that who ever sees  can easily understand and the link of the website shown also gives prominent example of the work done in the past.
### I checked that each and every nav bar when clicked takes the user to the desired page.
### I tested the links on the footer opens perfectly.
### I tested that the Download button is working perfectly and my Resume can easily be downloaded.
### I tried checking on the social media links as well and it was opening as expected.

# Testing in different browsers
## I manually tested the website on the following web browsers, checking that buttons, responsiveness and design worked as planned:
### Google Chrome
### Mozilla Firefox
# Testing responsiveness
### I manually tested the live project by doing the following:

### Using Google Developer Tools to view the project on devices with different screen sizes.
### Asking for feedback from friends and family who opened and interacted with the project on their devices.


# Features:
### The project has 4 pages in total - Home, Resume, Projects and Contacts.
### There is navigation bar on each page and the header and footer is consistent on each page. There is a picture image on the left-hand side of the page which is again consistent on all the pages.
### In the 'Home' page About Me is written clearly. 
### On the Resume page, its all about my skills, educational background, Professional background and References that would help the recruiter to verify about me if required.
### In the'Projects page all my previous designed website links are shared.
### In the 'Contact' page, there is a contact form where people can contact me if they like my portfolio and work with me.

# Issues found
### In the contact page the'Submit' button is not working and for that I think knowledge of dot-PHP is required which maybe later I will learn in the course and will be able to implement it.
# Deployment to Heroku
### This project is deployed and hosted on Heroku.
### 
### 
# Cloning
### The code can be run locally through clone or download from the repository on GitHub.
### You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
